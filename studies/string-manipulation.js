/*String manipulationâ€”
With operators
String length to find the length of a string, use the built-in length property.

Example:
var txt = "ABC";
var a = txt.length;
With string method 
The slice() Method slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
The method takes 2 parameters: the start position, and the end position (end not included).
This example slices out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 12 (13-1):

Example:
var str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
var res = str.slice(7, 13);
The result of res will be:
//Banana
